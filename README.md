# shortcuts viewer
this is a work in progress sorry

## usage goals
a document to visit when u need to see a list of some program/editor's available shortcuts

for when youre asking yourself questions like these:
- how do i see shortcuts that use ctrl shift as modifiers
- how do i see shortcuts with multiple modifier combinations at once
- what shortcuts can i use while hovering over this element
- etc..

(im working with osu!lazer shortcuts for the examples on the page)
