# shortcuts viewer
this is a work in progress sorry

## usage goals
a document to visit when u need to see a list of some program/editor's available shortcuts

for when youre asking yourself questions like:
- what are the shortcuts that use ctrl+shift
- what shortcuts can i use while hovering over this element

(i will have osu!lazer shortcuts for the examples on the demo page)
